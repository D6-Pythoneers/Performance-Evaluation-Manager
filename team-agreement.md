Every Day we will have a briefing for upcomming and completed tasks before the daily stand-up meeting, 

Each team memeber must finish his tasks in the specified dead-line. 

If any tasks were overdue , Team leader must be informed and must help complete that task ASAP.

Team leader will evaluate and decide if the conflict must be resolved within the team or escalate the conflict to the instructional team.
and the project progress and tasks duetime must remain a priority.  

If the conflict was between any team member and the team leader , he must inform the instructional team of the conflict and the project progress and tasks duetime must remain a priority.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

We will prevent that from the beginning by distributing the tasks in project planning.
 
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

After tasks distribution complete , each memeber must review his tasks and approve on them based on his knowledge and skill level.


- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

each member have a task and a dead-line as mentioned above , team leader should help with completing a task but if there was no tasks were done or any work is completed. team leader must verbally inform the team member of his delay .

If that issue happened again , the team leader must inform the instructional team about the team member/s who are not contributing on their due-time tasks.

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
everyone will provide their ideas and thoughts in the daily briefing. 


## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
Describe at least:
- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Once our idea approved , the project must be analyzed and tasks must be created and distributed among team members based on their level of skills and strengths , which will be described in our project management tool ( TRELLO ) .

  - Trello 

## Git Process

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
    - The code and the data
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
    - Collaborate through organization  
- What is your Git flow?
    - **Gitflow workflow**
    This workflow employs two parallel long-running branches:

    - **Master**
    used for releases only
    
    - **Develop**
    created from Master, this is the home of all completed and stable features prepared for the next release

When you start working on a new feature, create a new `Feature` branch from `Develop`. Create as many feature branches in parallel as you want and need. When the work is done and the feature is tested, merge the code back to `Develop`.

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - we will be using github workflows to test each push and PR

Who merges PRs?
  - Odeh Abuzaid or Majed Al-Swaeer 

How often will you merge?
  - After each feature tests is implemented and passed we will do our merge part

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  - in daily briefing.
